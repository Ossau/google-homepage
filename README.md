Following the curriculum of The Odin Project's, this is a non-working but similar Google home page that i had to code by myself.
This is the first time i need to create a webpage on my own, even if it's just an easy copy.

-------------------------------

8 (non-continuous) hours later and it's finally done. I though I was good enough for this to be a breeze, i was wrong. My main obstacles were display: block and box-sizing: border-box that i didn't add, creating some mindfucking layout error. I had some problem with the sign in button until i realized i needed to cut the height property. It was really useful to pratice what i knew, now i know how to use that knoweldge, but it's just the beginning.
